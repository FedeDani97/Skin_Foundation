# Skin_Foundation

This repository contains the code related to my MSc final project at UCL. 
The project investigate the ability of Vision Foundation Models to classify close-up facial images related to different skin conditions (moisture, oiliness, elasticity, texture, hyperpigmentation), with a a small and highly imbalanced dataset, making use of Stable Diffusion model (img2img) for data augmentation to improve data diversity and model robustness.

It is organized as follows: 
- Core notebooks: 1_Data augmentation and 2_Foundation Models
- Helpers
- Visualisation plots: 0_plots (included in the report)
